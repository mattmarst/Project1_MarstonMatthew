# Project 1 Overview

The code begins by asking the user what operation they would like to use. It shows the possible inputs that the user can type. Once the user inputs the operation, it is converted to lowercase so the user only has to spell the operation correctly. If it is spelled incorrectly it will output a string telling the user that the operation is not supported or is spelled incorrectly. It then asks the user for two input numbers depending on the operation. Finally, it outputs the answer as a string.
